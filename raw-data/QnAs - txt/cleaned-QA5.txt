When to use Python or not?
If the programmer is more important than the program - use Python
When the program is more important than the programme - consider other options
####

Python: how we describe a collection that is immutable?
We describe it as hasable
####

What are Python's sequences and which is mutable?
str, tupe and list; list is the only mutable one
####

Python: set vs dict?
A set is an unordered collection. 
A dictionary is an unordered collection of data that stores data in key-value pairs.
In other words:
The set type is a mutable Set
The dict type is a mutable Mapping
####

Python: difference between Sequence and Set
Sequence: an ordered collection of data elements.
Set: an unordered collection of unique data elements.
####

Python: what is iterable?
An object that can produce a stream of elements of data.
####

Python: what is Mapping
An unordered collection associating elements of data (keys) 
to other elements of data (values).
####

Python: difference between / and // operator
Python has two division operators, a single slash character for classic division 
and a double-slash for “floor” division (rounds down to nearest whole number). 
####

Python: what are the floor, the reminder and the exponential operators?
The floor is //: 13 // 4 = 3
The reminder is %: 13 % 4 = 1
The exponential is **: 13 ** 4 = 28 561
####

Python: what is the representation of  character type?
Python has no character type – both ' and " create string literals. 
####

Python: what is chacter set for literals
Python supports Unicode by default
####

4 ways to format Python literals
greeting = 'Hello'
group = "wørld"
f-strings           f"{greeting} {group}!"
named groups        "{greeting} {group}!".format(greeting=greeting, group=group)  
positional groups   "{0} {1}!".format(greeting, group)  
C-style             "%s %s!" % (greeting, group)
####

Python: how to create multiline strings
Multiline string literals can be introduced and closed 
with three single quotes or three double quotes
"""Another long
quite long string.
"""
####

Difference between 1 == 1.0 and 1 is 1.0
The first one compares values. 
The second checks if this is the same object (have the same id)
So True and False
####

Common loss functions in regression
Sum of Errors
Sum of absolute errors
Sum of squared errors
Mean Absolute Error (L1 Loss)
Mean Square Error (L2 loss)
Root Mean Squared Error
Huber Loss
Mean Bias Error
####

What is softmax?
At th output of the last linear layer of neural network, 
it re-scale logits so that they lie in the range [0, 1] and sum to 1.
Defined by exp(x) / sum(x) - normalized exponential function
