If matrix A is 2 x 3 and matrix B 3 x 2
the what would be the size of A * B?
2 x 3 * 3 x 2 - we crossing out internal dimention
and we left with 2 x 2
####

Multiple matrix A = [[3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 3]]
by matrix B = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
By hand and with torch
[[11, 29], [13, 31]]

How to calculate gradients of a function y = x**2 + z**3
at x = 1.0 and z = 2.0
x = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)
z = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x**2 + z**3
y.backward()
x.grad
z.grad

How to generate random float tensor in a range
max = 8
min = 4
x = (max-min)*torch.rand(10) + min

How torch.sort() method works?
This method returns two tensors. The first tensor is a tensor with sorted values of the 
elements and the second tensor is a tensor of indices of elements in the original tensor.
x = torch.rand(10)
x = x.sort()
x = x[0]

How to get floats from range -10 to 10 (2 ways)
Using torch.Tensor(1).uniform_(-10, 10)
It draws numbers sampled from the continuous uniform distribution 
so each number with the same probability
The other way is to use torch.distributions package
torch.distributions.uniform.Uniform(-100,100).sample([2,2]) 
>>> tensor([[36.8804, -7.5522],
            [-5.8788,  7.6381]])

How to assure we always get the same sequence of random data
By manually setting a seed
1 - torch.manual_seed(1) # value irrelevant, but it has to be the same all the time
2 - torch.rand(10)
Repeating the sequence of 1 and 2 always gives the same random dataset

How to combine two tensors in torch
Using torch.cat((tensor1, tensor2), dimen)
t1 = torch.rand(2, 2)
t2 = torch.rand(2, 3)
torch.cat((t1,t2), 0) -> error - attemps to connect 2 rows (2 cols) with 2 rows (3 cols)
torch.cat((t1,t2), 1) -> creates 2 rows (5 columns)
####

Difference between:
v1 = torch.Tensor([3,4,5])
v2 = torch.tensor([3,4,5])
v1 would be float32
v2 would be int64

What is an epoch in ML?
An epoch is whenever we perform a single pass through the entire training set
