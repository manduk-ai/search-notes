What is idempotence?
When performing an operation again and again gives the same result
for example, PUT http request is idempotent as calling PUT multiple times
will always produce the same results
####

What is Bias in machine learning?
Bias occurs when an algorithm has limited flexibility to learn the true signal from the dataset
In other words: bias is an error from faulty assumptions in the learning algorithm UNDERFITTING
A high bias means the prediction will be inaccurate.
A linear regression is an example of an algorithm with high bias. 
It's easy to understand and implement but not flexible to learn the underlying signal of the data. 
Thus, they are inaccurate for complex datasets.
####

What is Variance in machine learning?
Variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. 
High variance can cause an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data, 
rather than the intended outputs - it's called OVERFITTING
A high variance tends to occur when we use complicated models that can overfit our training sets
####

Explain Bias-Variance tradeoff
Increaing bias reduces variance and vice-versa
Unfortunately, you cannot minimize bias and variance at the same time.
You have to find a sweet spot by minimizing error defined as:
E = B^2 + V + irreducible error
####

What is overfitting?
Overfitting is a low bias and high variance problem. 
Algorithm is too compicated for the task and too sensitiv to small fluctuations in the training set.
In other words: the algorithm is memorizing instead of learning.
TRY: more training data or decrease model complexity
####

What is underfitting?
Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to capture 
the relationship between the input and output variables accurately, 
generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data
####

What are 5 methods for preventing overfitting?
1. Simplifying model
2. Data augmentation
3. Early stopping
4. Dropout
5. Regularization

Pytorch - how to create 
a) vector of size N filled with random floats
b) matrix of size N x M filled with random ints from the range of (10,100)
c) vector of size N with specific data
a) torch.rand(5) or torch.rand(5,)
b) torch.randint(10, 100, (3,4))
c) torch.tensor([1,2,3,4,5])
####

PyTorch - how to check type of data in a tensor?
m = torch.rand(5,2)
m.dtype
>>> torch.float32
####

What is the number of columns and rows in this tensors?
a) torch.rand(5,2)
b) torch.rand(3,)
a) matrix 5 rows x 2 columns
b) vector of length = 3. 
   Often presented in vertical (3 rows), but no dimentionality for vector
####

What is torch equivalent / counterpart of numpy.reshape?
Method torch.view()
v = torch.rand(10,2) # size 10r x 2c
v.view(4, 5) # size 4r x 5c
v.view(4, -1) # to infer size of the second dimention from the first one
####

Converting between tensor and numpy array and back?
a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
t = torch.from_numpy(a)
n = torch.numpy(t)
