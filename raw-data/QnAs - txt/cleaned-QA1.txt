What is Dependant variable? (3 definitions)
It's just a value on Y axis
In other words: outcome, response variable
####

What is Independent variable? (3 definitions)
It's just a value on X axis
In other words: predictor, explanatory variable
####

Statistics: what is a construct?
The construct is a proposed attribute of a person or phenomenon that often 
cannot be measured directly: health, memory, love
####

Statistics: what is a lurking variable?
A lurking variable (przyczajona zmienna) is a variable that has an important effect 
and yet is not included among the predictor variables under consideration
E.g. smoking as a lurking variable in the research on influence of diet and exercising 
on health
####

What is a statistic?
A number that describes a sample
####

Difference between bar chart and histogram
With bar charts, each column represents a group defined by a categorical variable
With histograms, each column represents a group defined by a continuous, quantitative variable.
####

Positively vs negatively skewed distribution
Positively - more data near zero 
Negatively - few values near zero, more data away from zero
####

What is Standard Deviation?
Most common measure of spread. How far away, on average, a single data point is from the mean.
Square root of Variance. Its symbol is greek letter sigma. In a normal distribution approximately:
68% of data falls into one standard deviation 
95% of data falls into 2 standard deviations
####

Statistics: what is mode?
The value at which the frequency is the highest. 
The value most often in the sample.
On a histogram that would be the highest bin.
####

Uniform vs Bimodal distribution
Uniform has no mode. It’s flat. 
Bimodal has two modes.
####

What is Variance?
Measure of how spread out a data set is.
Formula: the average squared deviation sum(D^2)/n
or SUM((x - mean)^2)/N
N for the population, N-1 for a sample
####

What is mean/average vs median?
Mean/Avarage - arithmetic mean
Median - the value in the middle of the distribution
####

What is Outlier?
An observation that lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution
####

What is the first quartile?
The first quartile is the point where 25% of the distribution is below that point, and 75% of the data is above that point.
####

What is the Bessel’s Correction?
Calculating variance / SD by dividing by n-1, instead of n
We do this because variability of a sample would be always lower that the variability 
of a population, as sampling usually takes data from around a mean as 68% of data falls 
in one standard deviation. So SD of a small sample would be smaller than SD of a population.
####

What is Monte Carlo simulation?
Risk analysis method. It builds models of possible results by substituting a range of values
for any factor that has inherent uncertainty. Then it calculates results over and over, 
each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions.
It produces distributions of possible outcome values.
It assumes that random sample tends to have the same properties as a population
####

Difference between traditional and ML systems?
Traditional system are developed using code
ML system are developed using data
####

What is z-score?
Calculated (X-mean)/SD
How far from the mean a data point is in standard deviations
Z-score equals to 0 means we at the mean
####

What is a standard normal distribution?
A normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1.
A normal distribution can be converted to the standard normal distribution
by calculating z-score for every x value 
####

What is a probability?
Number that reflects the likelihood that a particular event will occur
####

What is CFD Cumulative Distribution Function?
CDF is the probability that a random variable, say X, will take a value less than or equal to some value y.
If you roll a die, the probability of obtaining 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is 16.667% (=1/6). 
The CDF of 2 is the probability that the next roll will take a value less than or equal to 2 and is equal to 33.33%
####

What if PDF Probability Den
PDF is the probability that a random variable, say X, will take a value exactly equal to some value y.
If you roll a die, the probability of obtaining 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 is 16.667% (=1/6). 
The PDF or the probability that you will get exactly 2 will be 16.667%.
####

What is percentile?
percentage of values that fall below a particular value in a set of data scores
Median is the 50th percentile
80th percentile means 80 percent values were lower than yours and 20 percent of the students' scores were higher than yours.
####

What is a Binomial Distribution?
A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment
that is repeated multiple times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes
####

What is sampling distribution?
It's a distribution of sample mean
The mean of the sampling distribution will always be the same as the mean of the original non-normal distribution
####

What is  the central limit theorem (CLT)?
CLT gives us a way to turn a non-normal distribution into a normal distribution. 
It tells us that, even if a population distribution is non-normal, its sampling distribution 
of the sample mean will be normal for a large number of samples (at least 30)
The CLT is useful because it lets us apply what we know about normal distributions, 
like the properties of mean, variance, and standard deviation, to non-normal distributions
