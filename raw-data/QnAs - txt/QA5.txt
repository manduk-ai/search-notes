Q: What are Python's sequences and which is mutable?
A: str, tupe and list; list is the only mutable one

Q: Python: set vs dict?
A: A set is an unordered collection. 
A: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data that stores data in key-value pairs.
A: In other words:
A: The set type is a mutable Set
A: The dict type is a mutable Mapping

Q: Python: difference between Sequence and Set
A: Sequence: an ordered collection of data elements.
A: Set: an unordered collection of unique data elements.

Q: Python: what is iterable?
A: An object that can produce a stream of elements of data.

Q: Python: what is Mapping
A: An unordered collection associating elements of data (keys) 
A: to other elements of data (values).

Q: Python: difference between / and // operator
A: Python has two division operators, a single slash character for classic division 
A: and a double-slash for “floor” division (rounds down to nearest whole number). 

Q: Python: what are the floor, the reminder and the exponential operators?
A: The floor is //: 13 // 4 = 3
A: The reminder is %: 13 % 4 = 1
A: The exponential is **: 13 ** 4 = 28 561

Q: Python: what is the representation of  character type?
A: Python has no character type – both ' and " create string literals. 

Q: Python: what is chacter set for literals
A: Python supports Unicode by default

Q: 4 ways to format Python literals
A: greeting = 'Hello'
A: group = "wørld"
A: f-strings           f"{greeting} {group}!"
A: named groups        "{greeting} {group}!".format(greeting=greeting, group=group)  
A: positional groups   "{0} {1}!".format(greeting, group)  
A: C-style             "%s %s!" % (greeting, group)

A: with three single quotes or three double quotes

Q: Difference between 1 == 1.0 and 1 is 1.0
A: The first one compares values. 
A: The second checks if this is the same object (have the same id)
A: So True and False

Q: Common loss functions in regression
A: Sum of Errors
A: Sum of absolute errors
A: Sum of squared errors
A: Mean Absolute Error (L1 Loss)
A: Mean Square Error (L2 loss)
A: Root Mean Squared Error
A: Huber Loss
A: Mean Bias Error

Q: What is softmax?
A: At th output of the last linear layer of neural network, 
A: it re-scale logits so that they lie in the range [0, 1] and sum to 1.
A: Defined by exp(x) / sum(x) - normalized exponential function
